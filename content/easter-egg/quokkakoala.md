# The Story Behind QuokkaKoala

You found the Easter egg! 🎉

## Why QuokkaKoala?

In reliability engineering, you need two things: **the energy and adaptability of a quokka**, and **the stability and resilience of a koala**. 

Both are survivors in challenging environments—just like systems at scale.

---

### The Quokka 🦘
- **Adaptable:** Thrives on isolated islands with limited resources
- **Optimistic:** Known as the world's happiest animal
- **Resilient:** Survives in harsh Australian ecosystems
- **Social:** Works well in groups

### The Koala 🐨
- **Focused:** Survives on a single food source (eucalyptus)
- **Stable:** Methodical and deliberate
- **Persistent:** Sleeps 20 hours but uses energy wisely
- **Resilient:** Thrives despite environmental challenges

---

### In SRE Terms:

**Quokka Energy** = Quick adaptation, rapid response, staying positive during incidents  
**Koala Stability** = Methodical problem-solving, stable systems, persistent optimization

Together? The perfect balance for building reliable infrastructure at scale.
